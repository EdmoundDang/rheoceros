## How to run

$ bb test_integ


## what to put in 'test_integration.intelliflow...'

Only the things (helpers, etc) specific to RheocerOS core framework integration tests.

If it is an essential mechanism that would be required (or even convenient, reusable) for application packages
that will rely on RheocerOS, then checked in under 'src/intellifow/mixins' or somewhere else within the release
bundle, framework source code.
